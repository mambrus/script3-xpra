This package exists to overcome some of xpra's shortcomings.

xpra is a fine tool, but it has two serious flaws:

* There's no easy way to figure out what runs which session

* xpra requires a terminal (aka xterm) to be alive when attaching. Killing that terminal will also detach the corresponding x-session. Forcing the user to have an extra terminal up wastes display real-estate. Even if terminal is reused for other purposes, there is still always a risk of killing it inadvisedly. Especially if you (like me) have tons of terminals active and need to clean up every now and then.

Both of these flaws are overcome in the tool winselect, but this i in my mind overkilling the problem. It also lacks one feature I really wanted to have:

* xpra.teleport.sh

This is an old QNX inspired concept, where a (X-)session instead of first being detached, then picked up by a recipiency host, is instead is sent to it. There are use-cases where this is really useful.



Technical discussion
============
#1 is solved by maintain a "database" which maps names to X session ID:s. This is done by simple temp-files, but to work bi-directionally there is a restriction introduced: There must me exactly one xvfb per application running. xpra accepts several applications to use the same xvfb even thoug this is not a common use-case (winselect does not utilize the possibility either) I'm still mentioning it.

#2 is handled by letting screen run as a daemon and handling all requests. Srceen has it's own internal terminal even when detached. I.e. even if not visible, it will still handle the requests and still keep the X-sessions alive. As an additional benefit one can get the screen-session up and have a look what it's doing. The sessions willl be named following a convention where each user logged in gets it's own daemonized screen called xpra-${USER}.

The only quirk using screen is that to run it as a daemon, one has to have had it attached at least once.

The following discussion helped figured out how to work around the limitation:
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/how-to-send-a-command-to-a-screen-session-625015/

And the result us as in the following example:
screen -S xpra-me -p0 -X stuff "xpra attach :10 &"`echo -ne '\015'`

 -or-

screen -S xpra-me -p0 -X exec "xpra attach :10 &"

The latter has the disadvantage of that CR is not ecchoed, hence if you bring ut the sessions you will not see the prompts in-between commands.

#3 There's really nothing rocket-sciency about it. It's just having a script logging in to a remote host using ssh, then pick up a session from the "teleporter". Basically the same as you would do manually, but with the difference in that you don't have to physically move which saves you one run exra and which is especially useful if the remote host isn't withing arm-lengths distance.
